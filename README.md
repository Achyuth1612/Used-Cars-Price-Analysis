🚗 Used Cars Price Analysis and Prediction  
This project involves a detailed analysis and machine learning-based prediction of used car prices. By leveraging a real-world dataset, the project uncovers key pricing trends and develops a predictive model to estimate the market value of used cars based on various features.

🎯 Project Objective  
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a regression model that can accurately predict the resale price of used cars using key vehicle attributes such as brand, age, fuel type, kilometers driven, transmission type, and more.

📌 Key Features  
🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers  
Converted categorical variables to numeric using encoding techniques  
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Uncovered patterns in price distribution  
Visualized relationships between car features and price  
🤖 Machine Learning Models  
Trained regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
Evaluated performance using R², MAE, and RMSE metrics  
📈 Insights Generated  
Impact of brand and fuel type on resale value    
Effect of kilometers driven and ownership on price depreciation  

🧰 Tools & Technologies  
Python  
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation  
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization  
Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation  
Jupyter Notebook for iterative development  

🚧 Challenges & Solutions

Challenge:

Inconsistent entries in data

Multicollinearity in features

Imbalanced feature importance

Solution:

Cleaned and standardized fields like fuel type, owner, etc.

Used feature selection techniques to reduce redundancy

Applied ensemble models for more robust learning   

📊 Results    
Best-performing model: Random Forest Regressor  
R² Score: ~0.90  
The model can effectively estimate car prices within an acceptable error margin for most cases.  

📌 Future Enhancements  
Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit  
Integrate with a user interface for live predictions  
Expand dataset for better generalizability
